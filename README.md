# AVA Hosting Promo Codes and Latest Offshore Hosting Deals for 2026

## AVA Hosting Introduction

Picture this: You're scrolling through endless hosting providers, and they all sound the same. "99.9% uptime!" "24/7 support!" "Best prices!" Yeah, yeah, we've heard it all before. But then there's AVA Hosting—a company that's been quietly doing its thing since 2001, back when the internet was still figuring itself out.

Here's what makes them different. They're based in Moldova, which means they operate outside the typical US and EU jurisdictions. For some people, that's just geography. For others looking for DMCA-ignored hosting or offshore solutions, that's everything. They've got data centers that actually work, prices that won't make you cry, and they accept cryptocurrency if that's your thing.

AVA Hosting isn't trying to be fancy. They offer shared hosting, VPS servers, and dedicated machines. NVMe storage comes standard, DDoS protection is included, and their VPS Nano plan at 11€ yearly has become something of a legend in the low-end hosting community. The company started in the English-speaking market, expanded to Russian-speaking regions in 2002, hit Ukraine in 2008, and rebranded to ava.hosting in 2023 to go global.

What you get is straightforward: servers in Moldova with LiteSpeed for shared hosting, KVM virtualization for VPS, and full root access when you need it. They're not reinventing web hosting—they're just doing it reliably and affordably in a location that matters for certain use cases.

### Special Promotional Highlights

**VPS Nano Special:** This is the deal that got everyone talking. 11€ per year for a VPS with 512MB RAM, 20GB NVMe, and 100Mbps connection. It's a promotional price that AVA Hosting has kept running because of demand. No monthly option available—yearly only. When it's in stock, it sells out fast.

**Recurring Discounts:** Unlike most hosts that give you a discount once and then charge full price forever, several AVA Hosting promo codes offer recurring discounts. That means the 20% off applies to every renewal, not just your first payment.

**Black Friday/Special Events:** AVA Hosting typically runs 25% off promotions during Black Friday and other major events. These are sitewide discounts that work on everything from shared hosting to dedicated servers.

**DMCA-Ignored Offshore Hosting:** All AVA Hosting services are DMCA-ignored, operating from Moldova with flexible content policies. This matters for certain types of content that might face takedown requests elsewhere.

## AVA Hosting Reviews

Let's be real about what users are actually saying—the good, the mixed, and the "it depends."

**What Users Like:**

People consistently praise AVA Hosting's pricing. The VPS Nano at 11€ yearly and shared hosting starting at €1.99/month are hard to beat. Users on LowEndTalk forums frequently recommend them for budget-conscious hosting needs. The 24/7 support gets positive mentions, with response times typically between 15-30 minutes via ticket system or live chat.

Several long-term customers mention years of reliable service without major issues. One user stated they've had simple sites running for years with no downtime problems. The NVMe storage and LiteSpeed web server on shared hosting plans deliver solid performance for the price point.

The offshore location in Moldova is specifically valued by users who need DMCA-ignored hosting or want to host content outside typical US/EU jurisdictions. Multiple payment options including cryptocurrency (Monero, Bitcoin, Litecoin) make the service accessible globally.

**What Some Users Don't Like:**

The relationship with AlexHost has caused confusion in the community. Some users discovered the companies share infrastructure, which wasn't always clearly communicated upfront. This transparency issue bothered people who care about exactly whose network they're on.

A few users reported service suspensions for TOS violations, particularly around phishing complaints from Cloudflare. The company enforces its terms strictly—if you break the rules, don't expect leniency or data recovery options. For some, this is acceptable; others felt the response was too aggressive without enough investigation.

The 99.8% uptime guarantee is lower than the industry-standard 99.9%, which reflects their realistic positioning but might matter for critical applications. Email deliverability on shared hosting can be affected by other users on the same mail server, which is a common shared hosting issue but worth noting.

**The Honest Take:**

AVA Hosting isn't perfect, and they're not trying to be. They're a budget-focused, offshore hosting provider that delivers solid value if you know what you're getting. For simple websites, development servers, or projects that benefit from Moldova jurisdiction, they're a smart choice. For mission-critical production apps that need five-nines uptime and white-glove support, look elsewhere.

The community on LowEndTalk generally views them positively within their category. They're stable for a low-cost provider, responsive when issues arise, and honest about what their prices can deliver. Just read their TOS, understand their acceptable use policy, and you'll probably have a good experience.

**Best Use Cases:**

- Personal websites and blogs that don't need enterprise-grade infrastructure
- Development and testing environments
- Projects requiring offshore hosting or DMCA-ignored services
- Budget VPS for learning server administration
- Sites with moderate traffic that value cost over premium features
